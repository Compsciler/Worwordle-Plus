Play the

first if you haven't already!

Guess the combined 7-letter word in 6 tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will
change to show how close your guess was to the word.

All words and guesses are the result of merging two 5-letter words together,
where the last three letters of the first word match the first three letters of the second word.
For example, the word SIRENEW is the word SIREN merged with the word RENEW.
